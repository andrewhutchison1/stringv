\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Preliminary: Strings in C}
Arrays of type \texttt{T} and length $N$ in C are represented by an $N$-length
contiguous block of \texttt{T} objects.
Strings, being arrays of \texttt{char}, must be terminated by the \texttt{NUL}
character so that their length may be recovered (via linear search) in the case
they have decayed to pointers.
